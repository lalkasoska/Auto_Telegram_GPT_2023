Some might lack the time or creativity to come up with a design that complements their personal style and meets their practical needs, while others might not know where to start when it comes to decorating a new home or remodeling. Hiring an interior designer can be expensive and time-consuming. Besides, it can be challenging to find an experienced designer that aligns with the homeowner's preferences and taste.

Target Audience: Busy professionals, young homeowners, rental property owners, and people who want to refresh their living spaces without overspending on traditional interior design services.

Unique Selling Proposition: With Virtually Guided Interior Design Services, customers can enjoy affordable, professional design assistance from the comfort of their homes.

This will be highly convenient for people who don't have the time or budget to work with an in-person interior designer but still want personalized and professional assistance.

Revenue Model: The revenue for this innovative business model can be generated through paid subscriptions or fees per project. The company can also generate additional revenue from selective product placement from partner companies for complementary design items.

Insights on the Market and Consumer Behavior: The market for online interior design services is growing due to the increase in remote working and the COVID-19 pandemic. More people are seeking virtual solutions to their interior design problems. Online interior design services have the potential to disrupt traditional design services due to time efficiency and affordability.
